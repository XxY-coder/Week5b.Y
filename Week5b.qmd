# 1.How will I tackle the problem?
I will incorporate the code from Project 1 and calculate the expected Elo rating for each round. Finally, compute the difference between the actual total and expected total, then extract the top 5 overperformed and underperformed players.

# 2.What data challenges do I anticipate?
Since B/H/U have no real opponents, expected ratings cannot be calculated for these lines. To avoid errors, consider excluding them from the calculation.
